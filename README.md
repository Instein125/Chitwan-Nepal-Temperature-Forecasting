## Introduction

This project aims to predict the Earth Skin Temperature in Chitwan, Nepal, based on historical climate data. By utilizing time series analysis techniques and the SARIMA model, we aim to provide accurate temperature forecasts for the region.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the District Wise Monthly Climate Data for Nepal, obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) POWER Project. The specific parameter considered for analysis is the Earth Skin Temperature (TS). The dataset spans from 1981 to 2019, providing a comprehensive view of the temperature trends in Chitwan, Nepal, over the years.

## Methodology

The project involves various steps such as data preprocessing, visualization, stationarity checks, SARIMA modeling, and forecasting. The Python libraries used include matplotlib, numpy, statsmodels, pandas, and pmdarima, among others. The SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is employed to capture the seasonal patterns and make accurate temperature predictions.

## Results

The analysis reveals the presence of seasonality in the Earth Skin Temperature data for Chitwan, Nepal. The SARIMA model demonstrates robust performance in forecasting the temperature, as evidenced by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The project provides insights into the temperature trends and patterns in the region, which can be valuable for various applications and decision-making processes.
